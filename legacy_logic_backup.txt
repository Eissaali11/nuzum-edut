1) services/employee_finance_service.py
   - EmployeeFinanceService.create_liability_from_advance_payment(...)
   Evidence:
   - Global code search returned only its own definition.
   - No direct calls from routes (v1/v2), services, templates, or utilities.

     - get_employee_statistics
     - get_attendance_statistics
     - get_salary_statistics
     - get_document_expiry_report
     - generate_excel_report
   Evidence:
   - No imports/usages found in routes/services/modules runtime paths.
