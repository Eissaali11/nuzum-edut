cd d:\nuzm
Get-Process python | Stop-Process -Force
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py
```
Wait for: "Running on http://..."

### Step 2: Open Browser (1 min)
```
http://192.168.8.115:5000/dashboard
```

### Step 3: Look for New Sections (2 min)

- [ ] See "إدارة الرواتب"?
- [ ] Can expand/collapse them?

### Step 4: Test Links (3 min)
- Click "لوحة الرواتب"
  - URL: `/payroll/dashboard`
  - Load time: < 0.5 sec? ⏱️
  - See payroll records?

- Click "طلبات الموافقات"  
  - URL: `/leaves/manager-dashboard`
  - Load time: < 0.5 sec? ⏱️
  - See leave requests?

### Step 5: Measure Speed (2 min)

- Go to Network tab
- Reload page
- Look at load time (should be much less than before)
